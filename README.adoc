Test Filter is an intelligent test selection tool for Clojure projects that dramatically reduces test execution time by running only tests affected by your code changes. Instead of running your entire test suite on every change, Test Filter analyzes your source code dependencies and git history to determine the minimum set of tests that need to run.

IMPORTANT: This project source and documentation was completely written by Claude Code. It wrote more than I wanted and
I've not had time to verify the documentation. Feel free to play with it, but I make ZERO guarantees that anything works
as advertised.

=== Key Features

* **Dependency-aware**: Builds a complete symbol dependency graph using static analysis
* **Content-hash based change detection**: Uses SHA256 hashes of normalized code to detect semantic changes
* **Formatting-immune**: Ignores whitespace, indentation, and docstring changes - only logic changes trigger tests
* **Git-integrated**: Tracks file changes between revisions to identify affected code
* **Intelligent caching**: Incrementally updates analysis with content hashes, avoiding full re-scans
* **Multiple test frameworks**: Supports `clojure.test`, `fulcro-spec`, and custom test macros
* **Integration test handling**: Special handling for integration tests with broad dependencies
* **CLJC support**: Properly handles Clojure Common files with reader conditionals
* **Flexible output**: Multiple formats for integration with various test runners

=== How It Works

Test Filter uses a two-cache architecture to track which tests need to run:

1. **Analysis Cache** (`.test-filter-cache.edn`): Ephemeral snapshot of current codebase
   - Contains dependency graph and current content hashes
   - Completely overwritten on each `analyze!` command
   - Only used to communicate between CLI steps

2. **Success Cache** (`.test-filter-success.edn`): Persistent baseline of verified code
   - Contains content hashes of successfully tested symbols
   - Only updated when you explicitly mark tests as verified
   - Persists across sessions and builds

==== Workflow

1. **Analyze**: Build dependency graph and generate current content hashes
   - Parses all source files with clj-kondo
   - Creates SHA256 hashes of normalized function bodies (ignoring docstrings/formatting)
   - Writes snapshot to analysis cache

2. **Select Tests**: Compare current state vs. verified baseline
   - Loads current hashes from analysis cache
   - Loads verified hashes from success cache
   - Identifies symbols where current hash ≠ verified hash
   - Walks dependency graph to find affected tests

3. **Run Tests**: Execute the selected tests (user action)

4. **Mark Verified**: Record that tests passed
   - Updates success cache with hashes from current analysis
   - Only done after tests successfully pass
   - Creates new baseline for future comparisons

.Example: Formatting Change (No Tests Triggered)
----
1. Analyze: generates hash "abc123" for `foo/bar` (docstring + formatting)
2. User reformats docstring
3. Analyze: generates hash "abc123" for `foo/bar` (still same - normalized)
4. Select Tests: current hash = success hash → NO tests needed
----

.Example: Logic Change (Tests Triggered)
----
1. Success cache has: foo/bar → "abc123" (verified)
2. User changes `foo/bar` logic: (* x 2) becomes (* x 3)
3. Analyze: generates new hash "def456" for `foo/bar`
4. Select Tests: current hash ≠ success hash → change detected
5. Walk Graph: find tests depending on `foo/bar`
   - `baz/qux` uses `foo/bar`
   - `app/handler` uses `baz/qux`
   - `app-test/handler-test` tests `app/handler`
6. Return Selection: {:tests [app-test/handler-test]
                      :changed-symbols #{foo/bar}
                      :changed-hashes {foo/bar "def456"}}
7. User runs tests, they pass
8. Mark Verified: updates success cache with foo/bar → "def456"
----

== Installation

Add to your `deps.edn`:

[source,clojure]
----
{:deps {com.fulcrologic/test-filter {:mvn/version "1.0.0" }}

 ;; optional
 :aliases
 {:cli {:main-opts ["-m" "com.fulcrologic.test-filter.cli"]}}}
----

== Usage

=== Command Line Interface

==== Analyze Command

Analyze the current codebase and update the analysis cache:

[source,bash]
----
clojure -M:cli analyze
----

This command:

* Runs clj-kondo analysis on your source code
* Builds a complete symbol dependency graph
* Generates content hashes for all symbols
* Overwrites `.test-filter-cache.edn` with current state
* NOTE: Does NOT update the success cache - that's done with `mark-verified`

==== Select Command

Find tests affected by changes:

[source,bash]
----
# Basic usage
clojure -M:cli select

# With verbose output showing statistics
clojure -M:cli select -v

# Get all tests (ignore changes)
clojure -M:cli select --all
----

==== Output Formats

[source,bash]
----
# Fully-qualified test vars (default)
clojure -M:cli select -o vars

# Test namespaces only
clojure -M:cli select -o namespaces

# Kaocha command-line format
clojure -M:cli select -o kaocha
----

==== Status Command

Check cache status:

[source,bash]
----
clojure -M:cli status
----

Shows:

* Whether analysis cache exists
* Whether success cache exists
* Cache file sizes and timestamps
* Number of verified symbols (with -v flag)

==== Mark Verified Command

Mark tests as successfully verified (updates success cache):

[source,bash]
----
# Mark all selected tests as verified
clojure -M:cli mark-verified

# Mark specific tests as verified
clojure -M:cli mark-verified -t my.app.core-test/foo-test
----

This command:

* Updates `.test-filter-success.edn` with verified symbol hashes
* Should only be run after tests pass
* Creates the baseline for future test selection

==== Mark All Verified Command

Initialize the success cache by marking all symbols in the current analysis as verified:

[source,bash]
----
# Mark all symbols in the graph as verified
clojure -M:cli mark-all-verified
----

This command:

* Marks ALL symbols from the analysis cache as verified
* Useful for initializing test-filter on an existing large codebase
* Requires that you run `analyze` first
* After this, only new changes will trigger tests
* Creates the initial baseline without running any tests

==== Clear Command

Invalidate the caches:

[source,bash]
----
# Clear analysis cache only
clojure -M:cli clear

# Clear both analysis and success caches
clojure -M:cli clear --all
----

=== Programmatic API

Use Test Filter from the REPL or your code:

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[com.fulcrologic.test-filter.core :as tf])

;; 1. Analyze the codebase (generates current state)
(tf/analyze! :paths ["src/main" "src/test"])

;; 2. Select tests based on changes
(def selection (tf/select-tests :verbose true))

;; The selection contains everything needed for verification
selection
;; => {:tests [my.app-test/foo-test my.app-test/bar-test]
;;     :changed-symbols #{my.app/foo my.app/bar}
;;     :changed-hashes {my.app/foo "abc123..." my.app/bar "def456..."}
;;     :graph {...}
;;     :stats {...}}

;; 3. Show affected tests
(tf/print-tests (:tests selection) :format :namespaces)

;; 4. Run the tests (external - use your test runner)
;; ... run tests ...

;; 5. Mark verified after tests pass
(tf/mark-verified! selection)  ; Mark all selected tests
;; or
(tf/mark-verified! selection [my.app-test/foo-test])  ; Mark subset

;; Alternative: Initialize on existing codebase (skip testing)
(def graph (tf/analyze! :paths ["src/main" "src/test"]))
(tf/mark-all-verified! graph)  ; Mark everything as verified
;; => 141  (returns count of verified symbols)
----

=== Integration with Test Runners

==== Kaocha

[source,bash]
----
# Run only affected tests with Kaocha
clojure -M:cli select -o kaocha | xargs clojure -M:kaocha
----

==== Cognitect test-runner

[source,bash]
----
# Get affected test namespaces
TESTS=$(clojure -M:cli select -o namespaces)

# Run with test-runner
if [ -n "$TESTS" ]; then
  clojure -M:test -n $TESTS
fi
----

=== Initializing on a Large Existing Codebase

For large projects where you want to start using test-filter immediately:

[source,bash]
----
# 1. Analyze the entire codebase
clojure -M:cli analyze

# 2. Mark everything as verified (creates initial baseline)
clojure -M:cli mark-all-verified

# 3. Now only new changes will trigger tests
clojure -M:cli select -v
# => No tests need to be run.

# 4. Make a change to any file
# ... edit file ...

# 5. Analyze and select - only affected tests will run
clojure -M:cli analyze
clojure -M:cli select -v
# => Only tests affected by your change
----

=== Typical Workflow

[source,bash]
----
# 1. Analyze current codebase
clojure -M:cli analyze

# 2. Make code changes
# ... edit files ...

# 3. Analyze again to capture changes
clojure -M:cli analyze

# 4. Select affected tests
clojure -M:cli select -v

# 5. Run only affected tests
clojure -M:cli select -o kaocha | xargs clojure -M:kaocha

# 6. If tests pass, mark as verified
clojure -M:cli mark-verified

# 7. Continue development
# ... edit more files ...

# 8. Next iteration - analyze and select again
clojure -M:cli analyze
clojure -M:cli select -v
# ... only new changes will trigger tests ...
----

=== CI/CD Integration

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
# In your CI pipeline

# Analyze current PR branch
clojure -M:cli analyze

# Select affected tests (compares against success cache from main)
TESTS=$(clojure -M:cli select -o namespaces)

if [ -n "$TESTS" ]; then
  echo "Running affected tests: $TESTS"
  clojure -M:kaocha --focus $TESTS
  
  # If tests pass, update success cache
  if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    clojure -M:cli mark-verified
    # Commit updated success cache to track verified state
    git add .test-filter-success.edn
    git commit -m "Update verified test baseline"
  fi
else
  echo "No tests affected by changes"
fi
----

NOTE: The `.test-filter-success.edn` file should be committed to your repository to track the verified baseline across CI runs. The `.test-filter-cache.edn` file is ephemeral and should be in `.gitignore`.

== Advanced Features

=== Macro-Based Test Detection

Test Filter supports test frameworks that use macros instead of `deftest`:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns my-app.spec-test
  (:require [fulcro-spec.core :refer [specification assertions]]))

(specification "User registration"
  (assertions
    "creates a new user"
    (register-user {:name "Alice"}) => {:id 1 :name "Alice"}))
----

Detected test frameworks:

* `fulcro-spec.core/specification`
* Custom macros (configurable)

=== Integration Test Handling

Integration tests often have broad dependencies. Test Filter detects them by namespace pattern (`*.integration.*`) and applies special handling:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns my-app.integration.api-test
  (:require [clojure.test :refer [deftest is]]
            [my-app.system :as system]))

(deftest test-user-api
  (let [sys (system/start)]
    ;; Integration test
    (is (= 200 (:status (api-call sys))))))
----

Options for integration tests:

1. **Conservative mode** (default): Run integration tests when uncertain about dependencies
2. **Metadata targeting**: Specify exact dependencies with `:test-targets` metadata
3. **Configuration file**: External configuration for complex cases

=== CLJC File Support

Test Filter properly handles Clojure Common (`.cljc`) files with reader conditionals:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns my-app.utils
  #?(:clj (:import [java.nio.file Paths])))

(defn normalize-path [path]
  #?(:clj  (-> (Paths/get path (into-array String []))
               (.normalize)
               (.toString))
     :cljs (.normalize js/path path)))
----

* Analyzes only the `:clj` side of CLJC files
* Ignores pure `.cljs` files
* Tracks dependencies correctly across platforms

== Architecture

=== Content-Hash Based Change Detection

Test Filter uses a sophisticated approach to detect which code changes actually require testing:

1. **Parse with EDN reader**: Uses `clojure.tools.reader` to parse code as data structures
2. **Strip docstrings**: Removes documentation strings from function definitions
3. **Normalize formatting**: Uses `pr-str` to get consistent formatting regardless of whitespace/indentation
4. **Generate SHA256 hash**: Creates a unique hash representing the function's logic
5. **Cache hashes**: Stores hashes alongside the dependency graph
6. **Compare on change**: When files change, re-analyze and compare new hashes to cached ones
7. **Identify real changes**: Only symbols with different hashes are considered "changed"

This means:

* ✓ Adding/changing docstrings doesn't trigger tests
* ✓ Reformatting code doesn't trigger tests
* ✓ Reordering functions doesn't trigger tests
* ✓ Adding comments doesn't trigger tests
* ✓ Only actual logic changes trigger the appropriate tests
